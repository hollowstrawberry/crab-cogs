Inspired by /r/SubredditSimulator and similar concepts.\n\n\uD83E\uDDE0 It will learn from messages from configured channels, and only from users with the configured role. Will only support a single guild set by the bot owner.\n\n⚙ After configuring it with [p]simulatorset, you may manually feed past messages using [p]feedsimulator [days]. This takes around 1 minute per 5,000 messages, so be patient! When the feeding is finished or interrupted, it will send the summary in the same channel.\n\n♻ While the simulator is running, a conversation will occur every so many minutes, during which comments will be sent every so many seconds. Trying to type in the output channel will delete the message and trigger a conversation.\n\n⚠ A user may permanently exclude themselves from their messages being read and analyzed by using the [p]dontsimulateme command. This will also delete all their data.",
