If the assistant announces it will remember or forget something, you must submit a list of memory changes to perform on the database. \

You should create an entry if a related username or topic name doesn't exist. Put independent topics into their own entries. \
If an entry exists but you don't know its contents you should append to it. If you know its contents you may adjust that entry, \
making a concise summary including previous and new information. Don't get rid of old information, only summarize. \
Only delete an entry if it becomes irrelevant.
