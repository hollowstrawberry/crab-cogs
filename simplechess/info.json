The difficulty can be selected with the slash command.\nOnly one game may be active per channel, but it works in threads, and inactive games may be ended by any user. Games persist after a bot restart.\n```Cog installed. Instructions:\n1. Load it with [p]load simplechess\n2. Make sure ImageMagick is installed on the bot's host machine: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php\n3. Optionally, enable the slash command with [p]slash enable chess\n  3.1. Then do [p]slash sync\n  3.2. Then restart Discord.\n4. Start playing with the [p]chess or /chess commands\n5. Example to play against a friend with a bet of 100 credits: [p]chess @friend 100\n6.
