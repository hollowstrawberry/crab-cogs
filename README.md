# crab-cogs

This is an addon for [Red bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) for Discord, with features that I developed for my own friend group (called crab).

### Installation

To add one of these cogs to your instance of Red, send the following commands one by one (`[p]` is your prefix):
```
[p]load downloader
[p]repo add crab-cogs https://github.com/orchidalloy/crab-cogs
[p]cog install crab-cogs [emojisteal/simulator/crab]
[p]load [emojisteal/simulator/crab]
```

You may be prompted to respond with "I agree" after the second line.

## üß† Simulator

Designates a channel that will send automated messages mimicking your friends using Markov chains. They will have your friends' avatars and nicknames too! Inspired by /r/SubredditSimulator and similar concepts.

üß† It will learn from messages from configured channels, and only from users with the configured role. Will only support a single guild, and this is configured by the bot owner.

‚öô After configuring it with `[p]simulator set`, you may manually feed past messages using `[p]simulator feed [days]`. This takes around 1 minute per 5,000 messages, so be patient! When the feeding is finished or interrupted, it will send the summary in the same channel.

üîÑ While the simulator is running, a conversation will occur every so many minutes, during which comments will be sent every so many seconds. Trying to type in the output channel will delete the message and trigger a conversation.

üë§ A user may permanently exclude themselves from their messages being read and analyzed by using the `[p]dontsimulateme` command. This will also delete all their data.

### ‚ö† Usage Warning

This cog will store and analyze messages sent by participating users. The bot owner may also make the bot download large amounts of past messages, following Discord ratelimits. It will then store a model in memory whose approximate RAM usage is 60 MB per 100,000 messages analyzed. This data will be stored locally and won't be shared anywhere outside of the target server.

## üò∂ EmojiSteal

Steals emojis sent by other people (sends the image by default, useful for mobile users). You can optionally upload them to the current server if you have permissions, and even specify new names for them.

## ‚è∫ Autoreact

Lets you configure emojis that will be added to any message containing specific text.

## üñåÔ∏è Draw

A couple fun image filters for your friends' avatars. May take a minute to install due to the image processing libraries (opencv and Pillow).

## üé≤ Randomness

A few fun commands involving randomness, including:

* `donut` will give you a random dessert and keep track of your score. `donut set` will set a list of emojis to choose from, so you could technically alias this command as anything. [Some donut emojis here](https://imgur.com/a/9hW2RRf)  
* `rate` will give a unique rating from 1 to 10 to anything you ask. The bot won't change its mind!  
* `pp` will evaluate your pp size. You can't change it, just like real life.
